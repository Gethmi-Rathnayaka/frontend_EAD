## API Integration

The frontend is designed to work with a .NET backend API. The API service layer (`src/services/api.ts`) handles all HTTP communication with the following endpoints:

### Authentication

- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/signup` - User registration
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout

### Vehicles

- `GET /api/vehicles` - Get user's vehicles
- `POST /api/vehicles` - Add new vehicle
- `PUT /api/vehicles/:id` - Update vehicle
- `DELETE /api/vehicles/:id` - Delete vehicle

### Services

- `GET /api/services` - Get available services
- `GET /api/services/:id` - Get service details

### Bookings

- `GET /api/bookings` - Get user's bookings
- `POST /api/bookings` - Create new booking
- `PUT /api/bookings/:id` - Update booking
- `PATCH /api/bookings/:id/cancel` - Cancel booking
- `GET /api/bookings/available-slots` - Get available time slots

### Dashboard

- `GET /api/dashboard/stats` - Get dashboard statistics

## Key Features Implementation

### 1. Authentication System

## State Management

The application uses React Context for global state management:

- **AuthContext**: Handles authentication state, user data, and auth methods
- **Local State**: Component-level state for forms and UI interactions
- **API State**: Server state managed through API service layer

## Form Validation

All forms use React Hook Form with Zod validation:

- **Login Form**: Email and password validation
- **Signup Form**: Complete user registration with password confirmation
- **Booking Form**: Multi-step form with conditional validation
- **Real-time validation** with user-friendly error messages
